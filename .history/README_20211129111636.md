# code-quiz
## This is my coding quiz. It works but I'm going to list issues I still need to fix
### I finally removed the start quiz button once it was clicked. This was surprisingly easily.
### The timer finally stops when I finish the quiz and the finishes the quiz when it hits zero or less than zero. 
### the css is a mess and I'm having so much trouble fixing it that I'm about to just make it pink and hope nobody notices my buttons are all on one side. 
### I haven't yet gotten a perfect score on this stupid quiz so I think I put my answers in wrong. The questions are confusing anyway. Ok so I fixed this because it wasn't running for the last button click and so it didn't verify that last question score; it wasn't that I had put the answers in wrong.
