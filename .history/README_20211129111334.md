# code-quiz
## This is my coding quiz. It works but I'm going to list issues I still need to fix
### I removed the start quiz button, surprisingly easily.
### The timer finally stops when I finish the quiz and the finishes the quiz when it hits zero or less than zero
### the css is a mess and I'm having so much trouble fixing it that I'm about to just make it pink and hope nobody notices my buttons are all on one side.
### I haven't yet gotten a perfect score on this stupid quiz so I think I put my answers in wrong. The questions are confusing anyway.

### Here is my [git repository](https://github.com/Naomilounsbury/code-quiz)
