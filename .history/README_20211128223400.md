# code-quiz
## This is my coding quiz. It works but I'm going to list issues I still need to fix
### the start quiz button: I want it to disappear. It's ugly and I don't like it one bit.
### The timer doesnt stop when the quiz is over let alone stop the quiz. I know I need to do a callback function here. I will do it tomorrow 11/29.
### the css is a mess and I'm having so much trouble fixing it that I'm about to just make it pink and hope nobody notices wy buttons are all on one side.

### Here is my [git repository](https://github.com/Naomilounsbury/code-quiz)
